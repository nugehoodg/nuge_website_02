        <p class="text-justify">
            
        <b>Creative process needs creative thought;</b> it is the motivating drive for artists to move their brush. My sense of creativity is the curiosity of how much an abstract thought, or the unconscious, could be turned into a visual product. Any creative works stemmed from the product of our unconscious. The way I usually go on with my work is to start with a concrete concept of design, freestyle it, and go back around.
        <br>
        Here are some important notes before I start designing:
        <li class="list pl-8">
            <ol class="list-item list-decimal">Who's the target audience?</ol>
            <ol class="list-item list-decimal">What's the purpose?</ol>
            <ol class="list-item list-decimal">What's the goal?</ol>
        </li>

        It is generally good to start with these notes. Especially if you have a client to work with.

             I love <i>typography</i> and <i>painting</i>. That's why some of my design leans heavily on that style. Text and painting is the purest human expression ever put into a medium; it makes them alive! It expresses and communicates.

I grew up with films. I can confidently say that it helps to shape my design palette. When I first saw the magnificent film that is <i>Vertigo (1958)</i> by <i>Alfred Hitchcock</i>,
I was astonished by its opening sequence, especially those dizzying animations. And then I saw <i>Anatomy of a Murder (1959)</i> - there it is again, that opening sequence! What's going on?
My curiosity leads me into watching the entirety of the film's end credits... and there it was! Bass... <i>Saul Bass</i>...

Once I learned about him, I put all my heart and soul into knowing anything Saul Bass. I learned through the book, <i>Saul Bass: Anatomy of Film Design</i> by <i>Jan-Christopher Horak</i>, that he was such a hard-working man.
            He started a design firm called, <i>Saul Bass and Associates</i> - that's the part where I learned about the business of design. Oh, and this was his signature...

            That pretty much sums up his entire personality...

            These are the designs that have inspired me. They're not all Saul Bass, most of them are from Poland! There are no single photograph slapped on those posters,
            it's like a painting; and they're not hiding the fact that it is. It's unique, engaging, and invokes emotions.
